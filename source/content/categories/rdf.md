The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard system for modeling data
and relationships within data. It does not specify any storage, query, or
concrete representation methods, but there are enough common practices that RDF
makes sharing data possible without requiring lengthy or difficult negotiations
between projects.

## Libraries

Each of the languages we consider has a website dedicated to using RDF with that
language. Instead of listing each set of libraries, we provide links to those
websites. We use the appropriate libraries in each recipe.

- [Python](https://github.com/RDFLib)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby-rdf)
