Each play in Folger Digital Texts is rigorously encoded: every word, every
punctuation mark, every space, within a sophisticated, TEI-compliant XML
structure.

Using the encoded texts as a starting point is a significant time-saver in
creating mobile apps and other digital projects, or conducting research. We
are delighted to share our encoded texts at no cost for noncommercial uses. To
get started on your own scholarly research, or other projects, register with
Folger Digital Texts and download the text you need.
