Statistics is a mathematical endeavor that tries to provide quantitative summaries of large data collections. The validity of a statistical method depends on how well its application satisfies its assumptions. Typical statistical methods make statements about the data collection as a whole and say nothing about outliers or particular instances within the data collection.

In the recipes we present here, we try to outline the assumptions under which the method should be used along with possible interpretations of typical results. Be careful when using these methods. Make sure that the assumptions outlined in the recipe are true for your particular data set.
