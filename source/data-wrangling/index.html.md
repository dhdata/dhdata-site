Title: Data Wrangling
---
Digital Humanities is many things to many people. It combines the precision of computing with the fuzziness of human nature, the certainty of numbers with the shifting fashions of creativity. For every certain definition, there is someone somewhere doing Digital Humanities who doesn't fit, but that doesn't keep the field from thriving.

People with a cursory knowledge of Digital Humanities will tell you it's just Humanities with a bit of computation thrown in, or that it's Computer Science working with art or literature. While this can be the case, there are many who find a balance between the two where the humanities informs the computational approach and the science of computing pushes the humanities into new territory.

Many Digital Humanities problems involve tried and true computational techniques but with different data. Fortunately, the Digital Humanities have embraced open source software, so many of the tools that you need to explore data are available for free. If you need to do something with your data, someone else has probably already encountered the same problem. All you need to do is find the right tool. There are sites and blogs that mix in bits and pieces of this knowledge with running narratives of a research project or someone's experience in the field. There are even books designed for other fields that have useful techniques for the Digital Humanist. But searching through all of that material for the few nuggets that you need right now is daunting.

This book is a practical, hands-on guide to using various computational tools and techniques with data. You'll find some of the tools listed on the [Bamboo DiRT](http://dirt.projectbamboo.org/) site. Others aren't designed for Digital Humanities at all but are generally useful to a wide range of disciplines.

## Which Platforms and Versions?

We recognize that not everyone wants to (or can) use the same language, so we try to offer solutions in several languages when possible. Perl, Python, Ruby, and Scala are our primary languages for data processing. JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and LaTeX are our primary languages for data visualization. We will include PHP or Java if there are notable tricks or common use cases. If you know of a solution in a language that we haven't included, feel free to send an email to the [DHData-Discuss list](http://lists.dhdata.org/listinfo/dhdata-discuss) with your solution. We will try to include the best solutions for each problem.

We expect you to have a basic understanding of the language in which you are reading the solution. We won't explain common idioms in the various languages. There is plenty of introductory material on the web for each of the languages.

In general, we target the current version of each language that the language developer community considers stable for use in production programs. When there are multiple versions that are considered current (e.g., Python 2 and 3), we will try to point out how the solution might differ with versions.

## How to Use This Book

We didn't design this book to be read from cover to cover. It's a cookbook, and you should treat it like one. Identify the problem you are facing, and then see if there's a recipe that fits. Even if we don't have a recipe that matches exactly the problem you're working on, we might have something close enough that you can change a few things and get something that will work for you. Feel free to report your modifications and the problem you were working on to the [DHData-Discuss list](http://lists.dhdata.org/listinfo/dhdata-discuss) so that we can see if we need to add another recipe.
