Digital Humanities (DH) Data encourages the indexing and exploration of open data resources for humanities research. DH Data makes this easy for digital humanists and others conducting digital research by providing a growing number of visualizations and other tools or programming recipes for working with common forms of digital information arising from humanities research.

## How it Works

This site uses several open source software products including the data cataloguing software, [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), and the static site building system, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), running behind [Nginx](http://nginx.org/). The site uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) to manage content and metadata. 

## Contributing Recipes

Recipes in [the cookbook](https://www.dhdata.org/cookbook/) are kept in the [site git repository](https://github.com/dhdata/dhdata-site). Before contributing a recipe, fork this repository to your GitHub account. After creating your recipe and ensuring everything builds, create a pull request to the primary site repository. See the instructions in the repository for more information about how to create and submit a recipe.

### Prose.io

We've added a configuration file to the site repository for [Prose.io](http://prose.io/). After forking the site repostory into your GitHub account, you can add and edit recipes by going to [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) and selecting "dhdata-site" from your list of repositories. You will be placed in the appropriate directory into which you can add your recipe.

### Recipe Licensing

All recipe contributions are assumed to be made under a [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. If particular code snippets are available under a different Creative Commons license, then this should be noted in the recipe along with links to the source material from which the recipe is derived. Recipes not provided under a Creative Commons license will not be accepted.

## Contributing Data

This site uses [CKAN](http://ckan.org) to index information about openly licensed data that may be of interest in digital humanities research. Due to the spam issue seen in other open data index sites, we require that you register an organization or be associated with an organization before you may add datasets to the index.

### Registering an Account

To contribute datasets to the index, you will need to [register an account](https://www.dhdata.org/user/register) on the CKAN side of this site. Once you have registered an account, you will need to be associated with an existing organization or register a new organization.

### Registering an Organization

Once you have created an account in the CKAN side of this site, register your organization by sending the following template with your responses to [admin@dhdata.org](mailto:admin@dhdata.org?subject=Organization Registration) from the email address you used in registering your account. Once we have created the organization, we will associate you with the organization and send you an email.

```
Organization Name:

URL of the Organization Logo or Image (if any):

Secondary Administrator (name and email address):

Description:
```

### Requesting a Group

Groups are useful for collecting related datasets or datasets that might be useful for a particular part fo the Digital Humanities community. Groups need to be registered just as Organizations. You may request a group by sending the following template with your responses to [admin@dhdata.org](mailto:admin@dhdata.org?subject=Group Request) from the email address you used in registering your account. Once we have created the group, we will associate you with the group and send you an email.

```
Group Name:

URL of the Group Logo or Image (if any):

Secondary Administrator (name and email address):
