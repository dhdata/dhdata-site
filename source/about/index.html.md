Digital Humanities (DH) Data encourages the indexing and exploration of open data resources for humanities research. DH Data makes this easy for digital humanists and others conducting digital research by providing a growing number of visualizations and other tools for working with common forms of digital information arising from humanities research.

## How it Works

This site uses several open source software products including the data cataloguing software, [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), and the static site building system, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), running behind [Nginx](http://nginx.org/). The site uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) and [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) to manage content and metadata. User identity is managed with [Mozilla's Persona service](http://www.persona.org/). **Mozilla Persona may not work if you have disabled third-part cookies. If this is the case, you should be able to log in by creating an exception for the persona.org domain.**
