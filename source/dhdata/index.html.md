The notion of open data&mdash;information, public or otherwise, which anyone
is free to access and re-use for any purpose&mdash;has been around for some
years. In 2009, open data started to become visible in the mainstream, with
various governments (such as the USA, UK, Canada and New Zealand) announcing
new initiatives towards opening up their public information. Open data is
becoming the third aspect of scholarly publishing alongside open source
software and open access journal articles.

This book explains the basic concepts of 'open data', especially in relation
to digital humanities. It covers how open data creates value and can have a
positive impact in many different areas. In addition to exploring the
background, the handbook also provides concrete information on how to produce
open data.

The content of this book is composed of original material and material drawn

## Target Audience

This book has a broad audience:

- for those who have never heard of open data before and those who consider
- themselves seasoned 'data professionals' for digital humanists for data
- geeks and those who have never heard of an API.

Most of the information currently provided is focused on data held by digital
textual scholarship projects. However, the authors intend to broaden this as
time permits. You are welcome to participate to help us with that effort.

This book is intended for those with little or no knowledge of the topic. If
you do find a piece of jargon or terminology with which are aren't familiar,
please see the detailed Glossary and FAQs (frequently asked questions) which
are found at the end of the book.
