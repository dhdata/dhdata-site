Groups allow you to group together datasets under a community (for example, Theater History data) or topic (e.g. Shakespeare, Music, Environment) to make it easier for users to browse datasets by theme. Datasets can be part of a group, but do not belong to the group for editing or authorisation purposes.

Groups are a controlled vocabulary, unlike tags. In order to create a group, you must make a request using the [Request Group](/dhdata/request/group) form. Groups have an accompanying mailing list for discussions related to the group topic. If you request the group, then you will be the primary owner of the mailing list. You will also need to name a secondary owner who can act as a backup administrator for the group and the mailing list.
