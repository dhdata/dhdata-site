Groups allow you to group together datasets around a community or topic.
Communities might be theater history projects. Topics could be as broad as
"music" or as narrow as "Shakespeare." Groups make it easier for users to browse
datasets.

Groups are a controlled vocabulary, unlike tags. To create a group, you must
create a page in the  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dhdata/dhdata-site)
describing the group. You can add datasets to the group by listing them on the
group's page.
