Groups allow you to group together datasets under a community (for example,
Theater History data) or topic (e.g. Shakespeare, Music, Environment) to make
it easier for users to browse datasets by theme. Datasets can be part of a
group, but do not belong to the group for editing or authorisation purposes.

Groups are a controlled vocabulary, unlike tags. In order to create a group,
you must create a page in the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/dhdata/dhdata-site) describing the group.
Datasets are added to the group by listing them on the group's page.
