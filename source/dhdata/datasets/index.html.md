Open data is a tremendous resource that is as yet largely untapped. Many individuals and organisations collect or generate a broad range of different types of data in the course of their research. Scholarly data is particular significant in this respect because of the quality of the data. The focused experience of the scholar allows them to make informed decisions on which data to include or exclude, which naming authorities to use, and what normalization should be applied to the data. The resulting data reflects these scholarly activities.

There are many areas where we can expect open data to be of value, and where examples of how it has been used already exist. At the same time it is impossible to predict precisely how and where value will be created in the future. The nature of innovation is that developments often come from unlikely places.

It is already possible to point to a number of areas where open data is creating value. Some of these areas include:

- Participation
- Self-empowerment
- Improved or new products and services
- Innovation
- Improved efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of research projects
- New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data volumes

Economically, open data is of great importance as well. Several studies have estimated the economic value of open data at several tens of billions of Euros annually in the EU alone. New products and companies are re-using open data. Google Translate uses the enormous volume of EU documents that appear in all European languages to train the translation algorithms, thus improving its quality of service.

Open data is also of value for government itself. For example, it is making government more effective. The Dutch department for cultural heritage is actively releasing their data and collaborating with amateur historical societies and groups such as the Wikimedia Foundation in order to execute their own tasks more effectively. This not only results in improvements to the quality of their data, but will also ultimately make the department smaller.

While there are numerous instances of the ways in which open data is already creating both social and economic value, we don’t yet know what new things will become possible. New combinations of data can create new knowledge and insights, which can lead to whole new fields of application. We have seen this in the past, for example when Dr. Snow discovered the relationship between drinking water pollution and cholera in London in the 19th century, by combining data about cholera deaths with the location of water wells. This led to the building of London’s sewage systems, and hugely improved the general health of the population. We are likely to see such developments happening again as unexpected insights flow from the combination of different open data sets.

This untapped potential can be unleashed if we turn scholarly data into open data. This will only happen, however, if it is really open, i.e. if there are no restrictions (legal, financial or technological) to its re-use by others. Every restriction will exclude people from re-using the scholarly data, and make it harder to find valuable ways of doing that. For the potential to be realized, scholarly data needs to be open data.

## What is Open Data?

For our purposes, open data is as defined by the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/):

> Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone&mdash;subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

The full Open Definition gives precise details as to what this means. To summarize the most important:

- **Availability and Access:** the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.
- **Reuse and Redistribution:** the data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.
- **Universal Participation:** everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute&mdash;there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, 'non-commercial' restrictions that would prevent 'commercial' use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.

If you’re wondering why it is so important to be clear about what open means and why this definition is used, there's a simple answer: **interoperability**.

Interoperability denotes the ability of diverse systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate). In this case, it is the ability to interoperate&mdash;or intermix&mdash;different datasets.

Interoperability is important because it allows for different components to work together. This ability to componentize and to 'plug together' components is essential to building large, complex systems. Without interoperability this becomes near impossible&mdash;as evidenced in the most famous myth of the Tower of Babel where the (in)ability to communicate (to interoperate) resulted in the complete breakdown of the tower-building effort.

We face a similar situation with regard to data. The core of a "commons" of data (or code) is that one piece of "open" material contained therein can be freely intermixed with other "open" material. This interoperability is absolutely key to realizing the main practical benefits of "openness": the dramatically enhanced ability to combine different datasets together and thereby to develop more and better products and services.

Providing a clear definition of openness ensures that when you get two open datasets from two different sources, you will be able to combine them together, and it ensures that we **avoid our own 'tower of babel': lots of datasets but little or no ability to combine them together into the larger systems where the real value lies.**
