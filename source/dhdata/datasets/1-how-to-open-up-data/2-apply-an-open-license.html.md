In most jurisdictions there are intellectual property rights in data that prevent third-parties from using, reusing and redistributing data without explicit permission. Even in places where the existence of rights is uncertain, it is important to apply a license simply for the sake of clarity. Thus, **if you are planning to make your data available you should put a license on it**&mdash;and if you want your data to be [open](http://opendefinition.org/) this is even more important.

What licenses can you use? We recommend that for 'open' data you use one of the licenses conformant with the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) and marked as suitable for data. This list (along with instructions for usage) can be found at:

- [http://opendefinition.org/licenses/](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/)

A short 1-page instruction guide to applying an open data license can be found on the Open Data Commons site:
