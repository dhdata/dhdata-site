Organizations act like publishing departments for datasets. For example, the
Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities is an organization. You can
associate datasets with the organization responsible for its maintenance. This
allows you to find other related datasets produced or maintained by the same
group of people.

Datasets may only belong to only one organization. You must create a page for
the organization before you can associate a dataset with it. Once we published
the page, the organization will appear in the list of organizations when editing
the dataset. This will let you associate the organization with the dataset.

## Creating an Organization

To create an index page for an organization, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Open the `organizations` folder

All organization pages are in the `organizations` folder. Selecting the folder will
list all the organizations.

<div class="text-center">
	<img class="illustration" src="/images/dhdata/organizations/folder-list.png" height="446" width="640" border="0" vspace="0" hspace="0">
</div>

### Step 2: Create a new document

Selecting the `New File` button at the top of the page will open up an edit window
with the organization template loaded. Use the organization's name as the title of the file.

### Step 3: Describe the organization

The document body is a prose description of the organization. You should not
include any links to datasets in the document. When we publish the organization
page, a list of associated datasets will follow this body.

### Step 4: Add organization metadata

In the metadata editor, add the URLs of the organization logo and homepage.

### Step 5: Save organization file

Save the document. The suggested filename will reflect the name of the organization
as set in the document title. This will form the unique identifier for the
organization in dataset metadata and elsewhere.

### Step 6: Submit a pull request

Finally, submit a pull request for the organization page. Once we publish the
organization page, you may associate a dataset with it by editing the dataset's
metadata.
