Organizations act like publishing departments for datasets (for example, the
Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities). This means that datasets 
can be associated with an organization responsible for its maintenance, allowing
you to discover other datasets that might be related because they are produced
or maintained by the same group of people.

Datasets may only belong to at most one organization. Before you can associate
a dataset with an organization, you must create a page describing the organization
similar to the page describing a dataset or group. After the organization page is
published, the organization will appear in the list of available organizations when
editing the dataset page metadata, allowing you to associate the organization with
the dataset.

## Creating an Organization

To create an index page for an organization, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Open the `organizations` folder

All organization pages are in the `organizations` folder. Selecting the folder will
list all of the organizations.

### Step 2: Create a new document

Selecting the `New File` button at the top of the page will open up an edit window
with the organization template loaded. Use the organization's name as the title of the file.

### Step 3: Describe the organization

The document body is a prose description of the organization. You should not
include any links to datasets in the document. When the organization page is built,
this body will be followed by a list of datasets associated with the organization. 

### Step 4: Add organization metadata

In the metadata editor, add the URLs of the organization logo and homepage.

### Step 5: Save organization file

Save the document. The suggested filename will reflect the name of the organization 
as set in the document title. This will form the unique identifier for the 
organization in dataset metadata and elsewhere.

### Step 6: Submit a pull request

Finally, submit a pull request for the organization page to be published. Once the 
organization page is published, you may associate datasets with the organization by 
editing the dataset metadata.
