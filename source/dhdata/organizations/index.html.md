Organizations act like publishing departments for datasets (for example, the
Department of Health). This means that datasets can be published by and belong
to a department instead of an individual user. Within organizations, admins
can assign roles and authorisation its members, giving individual users the
right to publish datasets from that particular organisation (e.g. Office of
National Statistics).
