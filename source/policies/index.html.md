Welcome to Digital Humanities Data ("DH Data"). We have compiled our various policies into this document for quick and easy reference.

* [Terms of Use](#terms-of-use)
* [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy)

<a name="terms-of-use"></a>

## Terms of use

These are the general terms and conditions on which we supply all our services. If you use our services, you agree to abide by these terms.

We supply a number of different services. Some of them will have specific terms tailored for them. If that is the case, our contract with you for that service will be on these terms, supplemented by any terms specific to the service. In the case of any conflict, service specific terms will take precedence.

We process personal data in accordance with our [privacy policy](#privacy-policy). As part of this agreement, you consent to our doing so. You should read the policy carefully, especially if you have any concerns about your privacy.

We would hope that the following would go without saying, but please take note of our **warning: unless we have agreed to a particular level of service with you, we make absolutely no promises about the quality or existence of any of our services. Please read the sections below and our general exclusion of liability.**

All use of our web services are subject to our terms for web users. There are further terms if you have signed up for an account with one of our services. At the end are some general terms and definitions.

## Terms for use of our web services

Web services include our API's as well as any of our websites.

### Disclaimer

While we are proud of the services we provide to the world for free and try to make them reliable and useful, we make no promises about them. All web services are certain to fail some of the time. We adapt and change our services from time to time, so you may find that something that worked for you may cease to work. We may also stop supplying any service, temporarily or permanently or block access to our services to anyone for any reason.

We are not a law firm and nothing we do is intended to be taken as legal advice. In particular:

* We encourage the use of [open data commons licences](http://okfn.org/licenses/) but we cannot give any warranty that they will work in the way expected or should be used for any specific purpose. If in doubt, you should take your own legal advice.

* Copyright law is complex and there may be obscure cases that are not handled correctly.

### What you agree

You agree not to use our websites to do any of the following:

* anything which is illegal either where you are in the world, or where we are,

* cause nuisance to other users of our services,

* interfere with the normal running of our services,

* try to access our systems in a way other than those advertised by us and, in particular, to use a web crawler that does not respect the robots exclusion policy.

### Other websites

Some of our activities are carried out on web platforms provided by third parties. If you make use of any service where that is the case, you are responsible for complying with any terms of service of the third party platform.

### Accounts

Some of our services require you to create an account in order to make certain, or any, use of the service. All our accounts are subject to the following rules.

#### Rules for our accounts

You must be at least 13 years old and a human being.

If asked for any personal details, you must answer truthfully (see our [privacy policy](#privacy-policy) for what we do with those details). You must supply us with a valid e-mail address.

You are responsible for the security of your accounts and making sure that any contact details in the account are kept up to date. If we need to contact you but are unable to do so, for example because your e-mail address is no longer valid, then any consequences of that failure will be your responsibility.

You must not let anyone else use your account. If pressure is applied to you to do so&mdash;for example if an employer demands your username and password&mdash;please inform them that their attempt to subvert your agreement with us will mean that they have no permission to use any of our services. We may take action, including criminal prosecution, if they use our services using an account they have obtained in this way.

You must let us know of any unauthorised use of your account as soon as you are able to after becoming aware of it.

Unless an account is associated with a paid-for service, we may suspend or terminate it at any time. Equally, you may close your account at any time.

### Content and intellectual property

#### What we do with your content

If you contribute content to any of our services, for example by commenting on a blog, or uploading data, then as a general rule you agree to licence that content to us under the same licence as prevails for that service or website.

For example: any comment you make on the DH Data blog, which is licensed under a CC-BY licence, will be licensed to us under the same licence.

The only exception to this policy is where a service we supply to you expressly allows a different licence, for example creating a dataset allows you to select a license for that dataset.

#### Our content

Unless otherwise stated all our services are offered under open content or data licences and you should refer to the provisions of the licence in question to find out what you are allowed to do. Some of our content belongs to third parties. Most third party data is subject to an open licence, but we cannot guarantee it. You should refer to the third party if you are in doubt.

#### Ownership does not change

As a general rule, this agreement will not change the ownership of any intellectual property belonging to either party. Where your content is used by us or vice versa both you and we would do so under a licence (see above).

### Liability

#### Indemnities&mdash;where you may owe us

If you breach any of your obligations under this agreement and, as a result, cause us to be sued by anyone else, you will have to compensate us for any loss we have suffered as a result, which includes any costs, such as paying lawyers, or for our own time, we incur defending a claim as well as any damages awarded. If your breach causes you to be sued by someone else, you will not sue us for any loss you suffer as a result.

#### Exclusion&mdash;what we do not owe you

We limit our liability in several different ways&mdash;all of which we believe to be fair. In case any one of them is found to be unenforceable by a court, each of the following limitations of liability is separate and our liability to you is limited by all of them.

All exclusions of liability are only in so far as we are allowed to do so by whatever law applies to the situation.

We will not be liable for any damage that was not reasonably foreseeable at the time we made this agreement.

Any liability to you is limited by the amount you have paid us for a service. In the case of free services, our liability is zero.

We are not liable for any loss which is indirect or consequential. That includes any loss of business or profit.

We exclude, in so far as we are allowed, any warranties that would be implied by law.

### General conditions

#### This agreement

We may update these terms and conditions at any time. If we do so, we will announce the change on our blog. Any changes will be binding on you from the moment we announce them.

This agreement is made under the laws of the State of Maryland and the United States of America.

#### Boilerplate

These final "boilerplate" terms of should go without saying, but we are saying them anyway just to be clear.

If any part of this agreement is ineffective (for example because it is unlawful) then the rest of the agreement should be read without it.

This agreement is between you and us and is not intended to give anyone else any rights.

We may sometimes fail to enforce our rights under this agreement (for example because we decide not to, or we did not realise you were in breach of contract). Just because we have not enforced any of our rights, does not stop us from doing so in the future.

Neither party is liable for anything which is beyond their reasonable control.

If for some reason beyond our reasonable control, we are unable to or it would not be commercially viable for us to, continue to supply any of our services, we may cease to supply that service, ending any agreement between us for its supply. If we do so, we will return to you a fair proportion of any sum you have paid us in advance for the supply of that service, taking into account the service we have already supplied to you.

## Privacy Policy

### Summary

The DH Data family of websites collects no more data about you than most other websites. This policy describes our approach to your personal data.

As a general rule, we use information we have collected about you for the purposes you supplied it&mdash;for example, if you have ordered goods or services from us, then we will use it to help us supply those goods or services. We also use information we have collected from all our sites to help us understand how those sites are used in order to improve them or to design new services we might offer.

For our interactive sites such as blogs and wikies in particular, edits, comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks are published, and except in limited circumstances, will be a permanent part of this site. If you decide to comment, link, or pingback to a post, you must keep this in mind.

This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time to time. You may wish to revisit it regularly.

### Public data and publishing

Browsing this site doesn't reveal your identity publicly, though see Private Logging later in this document for more information.

### Author identification

When posting a comment or editing a page in the wiki, a name and email address may be required. You do not have to select your real name or use your regular email address. Your email address will not be published. If you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or attempt to use a remail service.

Page edits, comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks and other activity on our websites may be identified by your IP address. These numbers could potentially be traceable to identifying information about you, whether it is your home ISP or the University or Work account where the IP address is registered. Your IP address could potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you.

If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.

If so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing service. Please see http://tor.eff.org/ for more details.

### Email

If you have given us your e-mail address, you agree to allow us to send e-mail to that address in order to deliver our services to you. In practice, this will usually involve emails about service down-time or important changes to services to which you subscribe. Some e-mails&mdash;such as those subscribed to mailing lists&mdash;will receive more traffic as an integral part of the service.

In addition to necessary e-mails, we will occasionally use the e-mail to contact you for our own purposes. For example, we might want to tell you about new services we are offering or we might be seeking volunteers for one of our activities. We will only do so sparingly. We understand how annoying it can be to receive large quantities of unsolicited mail. We will do our best to ensure that anything we do send to you will be relevant and unobtrusive.

### Private logging

Any time you visit a page on the Internet, you send quite a bit of information to the server. The webservers that host his site maintain access logs with the information that you send. This information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here. We do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.

The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.

We also use web analytics services to get a general idea of the kinds of traffic our websites get in order to provide better services and to set benchmarks for how we are doing in meeting our goals.

Again, if you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.

### Data release policy

Our policy is only to release the data we collect in the following circumstances:

* As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.

* To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.

* When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.

* For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user's Internet Service Provider.

* If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.

* When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community or this website.

### No selling of information

We will not sell information collected via this site, such as your email address, to third parties.

### Information security

We make no guarantee that the information that you provide us will be secure.
