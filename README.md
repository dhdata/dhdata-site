Digital Humanities (DH) Data encourages the indexing and exploration of open
data resources for humanities research. DH Data makes this easy for digital
humanists and others conducting digital research by providing a growing number
of visualizations and other tools or programming recipes for working with
common forms of digital information arising from humanities research.

## How it Works

The DH Data site uses several open source software products including the static site
building system, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). This repository contains the 
source material from which the static site is built. This includes the guide to linked
open data in the Digital Humanities and the data cookbook.

## Contributing

Recipes in [the cookbook](http://www.dhdata.org/cookbook/) and [index information about
datasets](http://www.dhdata.org/dataset/) are kept in the [site git
repository](/source/content). Before contributing a
recipe or information about a dataset, fork [the repository](http://github.com/dhdata/dhdata-site)
to your GitHub account. After creating your recipe or dataset page and ensuring everything
builds, create a pull request to the primary site repository. See the
instructions in the repository for more information about how to create and
submit a recipe.

### Prose.io

We've created a custom build of [Prose.io](http://prose.io/). 
After forking the site repostory into your
GitHub account, you can add and edit recipes and other content by going to
[the site editor](http://www.dhdata.org/editor). You will be placed in the content directory into which you can
add your recipe or dataset information. The editor will use the appropriate
template when creating a new file.

### Recipe Licensing

All recipe contributions are assumed to be made under a 
[CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. If particular code
snippets are available under a different Creative Commons license, then this
should be noted in the recipe along with links to the source material from
which the recipe is derived. Recipes not provided under a Creative Commons
license will not be accepted.

### Dataset Licensing

The index page pointing to the resources and discussing the dataset is covered
by a [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. This
license does not apply to the resources pointed to by the page. All datasets
are assumed to be licensed under an open license. Please select the
appropriate license for each dataset as part of the page's metadata. If the
resources within a dataset are covered by different licenses, split the
dataset into two or more pages grouped by license.

If an appropriate license is not available in the list of licenses, then
select "Other Open License" if the resources are available under an open
license. If they are not available under an open license, then do not list
them on the page. You may include pointers to them in the discussion about the
dataset, but you should mention that they are not available under an open
license.

## License
