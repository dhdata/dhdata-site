# Things to be Done

If you want to help with the site but aren't sure what to do, feel free to pick up one of the items here. These
will eventually be placed in issues, but for now we're using a quick and dirty list.

For each item, create a feature branch in your fork of this repo. When you are finished, create a pull request with
your feature branch.
